## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS !

### What I learned

I learned about SASS! I'm starting with .scss files, but I'm pleased with how I've been able to catch on with mixins and variables and nested classes.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue using SASS to get even more comfortable with it. Additionally I'd like to feel more comfortable with Grid.
